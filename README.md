# Computer Vision Projects

Welcome to a collection of hands-on computer vision projects that demonstrate how AI can see and understand the world around us. From object detection and tracking to image segmentation, pose estimation, and automated annotation, these projects cover the core techniques powering modern vision systems.

Whether you’re working on retail automation, traffic monitoring, agriculture analytics, manufacturing quality control, or wildlife research, you’ll find practical examples here built with Ultralytics YOLO models i.e. [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) and [YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) and advanced tools like [Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2)](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/sam-2/). Each project includes code and documentation so you can learn, adapt, and apply these methods to your own real-world applications.
