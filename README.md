### How to Contribute 😊

1- ✅ Necessary: Ensure your use case is computer vision-based. It can belong to any computer vision task no restrictions! 🎉

2- ➖ Optional: For better user experience, upload a video of your implementation to YouTube and attach the URL for the community to watch. This step is optional, but highly encouraged!

3- ✅ Necessary: Create a documentation page for your use case.
- Include implementation details such as hardware configuration, model usage, and advantages.
- Place the file in the appropriate folder. For example, if it's an object counting use case, add it to: `docs/count/<your-use-case>.md`.

4- ✅ Necessary: Update the mkdocs.yml file: Add the relevant path under the nav section to make your docs accessible.

🎉 Final Step: Once all the changes are done, open the PR and If everything will looks good, I will merge your PR! 🥳
