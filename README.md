### How to Contribute

1- Ensure your use case is computer vision-based. It can belong to any computer vision task no restrictions!

2- For better user experience, upload a video of your implementation to YouTube and attach the URL for the community to watch. This step is optional, but highly encouraged!

3- Create a documentation page for your use case.
- Include implementation details such as hardware configuration, model usage, code with step by step explanation and advantages.
- Place the file in the `usecases` folder.

4- Update the mkdocs.yml file: Add the relevant path under the nav section to make your docs accessible.

ðŸŽ‰ Final Step: Once all the changes are done, open the PR and If everything will look good, I will merge your PR!
