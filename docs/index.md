## Object Detection | Advanced Applications

Object detection is a pivotal computer vision technique that identifies and locates objects in images or videos. It integrates classification and localization to recognize object types and mark positions using bounding boxes. Common applications include autonomous driving, surveillance, and industrial automation.
