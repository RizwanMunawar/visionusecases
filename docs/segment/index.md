# Instance Segmentation Use Cases

Instance segmentation is a computer vision method that breaks an image into distinct segments, each corresponding to individual objects or regions of interest. Unlike object detection, which employs bounding boxes, this technique labels every pixel, offering precise boundaries for each object. It finds applications in fields such as medical diagnostics, self-driving cars, and environmental analysis, where detailed object-level understanding is crucial.
