# Image Segmentation | Precise Pixel-Level Analysis  

Image segmentation divides an image into meaningful regions to identify objects or areas of interest. Unlike object detection, it provides a precise outline of objects by labeling individual pixels. This technique is widely used in medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and scene understanding.  

Explore our cutting-edge image segmentation projects, including contributions from our incredible community collaborators. Each project showcases real-world applications, hardware details, visual demonstrations, and workflow diagrams:
