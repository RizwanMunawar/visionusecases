# Object Detection | Unleashing Computer Vision Potential  

Object detection is a cornerstone of computer vision, designed to identify and pinpoint objects within images or video streams. By combining classification and localization, it determines object types and precisely marks their positions with bounding boxes. This technology is widely employed in fields such as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and industrial operations.
