# Object Tracking Use Cases

Object tracking is a computer vision technique used to monitor the movement of objects across frames in a video. It involves identifying objects in an initial frame and consistently following their positions, trajectories, or interactions throughout subsequent frames. Often combined with detection algorithms, object tracking is widely applied in surveillance, traffic monitoring, sports analysis, and autonomous systems to analyze dynamic scenes and behaviors.
