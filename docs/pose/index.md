# Pose Estimation Use Cases

Pose estimation is a computer vision approach that determines the spatial coordinates of key points, such as joints or landmarks, on a person or object's body from visual data like images or videos. By analyzing these points, you can capture the orientation, posture, or movements of objects. Frequently employed in fields such as sports performance evaluation, animation, and medical applications, pose estimation allows machines to better understand and engage with dynamic human or object behavior.
